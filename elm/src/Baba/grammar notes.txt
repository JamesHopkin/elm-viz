Calling L "Subject", R "Complement"

			L		R

Noun		x		x		(keke, wall)
Predicate	x		x		(all, empty)
Stative				x		(move, hot)

Complicates things having predicate separate
But important - they're not parameterised like nouns


Chain:

	text
	 |			-conjunction
	 v
	complement
	 |			-stative
	 v
	subject
	 |			-predicate
	 v
	noun

stack of 4 seems deep
	- 4-deep case to get noun from text?
	- results in nested JS objects?

Some way to implement tags?

Conjunctions = And | Not
Statives = Move | Hot
etc

Text = Conjunction Conjunctions
	| StativeText Statives
